# Preface

In software development, learning is a winning strategy. Imagine a way of learning where a group of smart people with different experiences come together and instead of talk about work, do the work. That is mob programming. You are in a right place in the group if you are either *learning* or *contributing*. Learning is the superpower that takes you to next level. Learning never stops.

## Growing Your Wizard

Teams have people with different skills areas and levels. Your team may have high level the warriors, who get through every battle alive. But your team may also have low level wizard, who will die in battle without their team protecting them, allowing them to collect the experience for leveling up.

We don't work only to do the work of today. We build the abilities to do the work of tomorrow. The low level wizard of today is the high level wizard of the future, who will cast a spell from the back row making your battles painless. But you need to support them while they get there, exposing them safely to the experience.

And even the most seasoned warriors amongst us have more to learn. Not only from other seasoned ones, but perspectives that enable us to work smart instead of hard.

In programming, we find the work we need to do as we do the work and our assumptions unfold into realities. Getting the best out of everyone into the work we are doing is worthwhile, enables learning and streamlines the results.
